Persistent Data: Volumes

A Docker volume is a persistent storage location that exists outside of the container. Volumes are useful for storing data that needs to persist even if the container is stopped or removed.

Volumes need a extra step to delete them, so they are useful for storing data that needs to persist even if the container is stopped or removed.


see al volumes: docker volume ls
inspect a volume: docker volume inspect [volume name]
remove a volume: docker volume rm [volume name]

set volume name: docker run -v [volume name]:[container path] [image name]
example: docker run -v my-vol:/app/data nginx

create volume: docker volume create [volume name] // Only reason to do it like this is driver


To set existing volume to container:
docker volume create psql
docker run -d --name psql -v psql:/var/lib/postgresql/data...



Bind Mounting (Must be on "container run")
run -v //c/Users/user/stuff:/path/container
run -v (host path):(container path)
# Cmmands in windows terminal
rn -v ${PWD}:/path/container (PWD = present working directory)


<!-- Dir to set volume postgres container -->
docker run -d --name psql -v ${PWD}:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456 postgres
