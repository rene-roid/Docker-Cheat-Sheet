# Docker Container Commands 🐳

Docker is a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies, making it easy to deploy and manage applications consistently across different environments.

## Creating Containers 🏗️

To create a Docker container, you can use the `docker run` command. Here are some of the commonly used options:

- `-d, --detach`: Run the container in the background.
- `--name <name>`: Assign a custom name to the container.
- `-p, --publish <host_port>:<container_port>`: Map a port from the host to the container.
- `--network <network>`: Connect the container to a specific Docker network.
- `<image>`: The image to use for the container (e.g. `nginx:alpine`).

Example:
```bash
docker run -d --name my_container -p 8080:80 my_image nginx:alpine
```

## Managing Containers 📊

Once containers are running, you can manage them with various commands:

- `docker ps`: List all running containers.
- `docker ps -a`: List all containers (including stopped ones).
- `docker stop <container>`: Stop a running container.
- `docker start <container>`: Start a stopped container.
- `docker restart <container>`: Restart a container.
- `docker pause <container>`: Pause a running container.
- `docker unpause <container>`: Unpause a paused container.
- `docker rm <container>`: Remove a stopped container.

Example:
```bash
docker stop my_container
```

## Inspecting Containers 🔍

You can inspect container details using the `docker inspect` command:

- `docker inspect <container>`: Display detailed information about a container.

Example:
```bash
docker inspect my_container
```

## Logs and Executing Commands 📝💻

To view container logs and execute commands inside a running container, you can use these commands:

- `docker logs <container>`: Display the logs of a container.
- `docker exec -it <container> <command>`: Execute a command inside a running container interactively.

Example:
```bash
docker logs my_container
docker exec -it my_container bash
```

## Removing Containers 🗑️

To remove containers, you can use the `docker rm` command. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible.

Example:
```bash
docker rm my_container
```

Docker provides a rich set of commands and options to manage containers effectively. By understanding and using these commands, you can harness the full power of Docker for containerized application development and deployment. 🚀
